      <h1>Policies & Terms of Use</h1>

      <h2>Order Acceptance & Right to Refuse</h2>
      <p>
        All orders placed through Desert Candle Works are subject to acceptance. We reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order at any time, for any reason, including but not limited to: 
        (i) product availability, 
        (ii) errors in product description or pricing, 
        (iii) suspected fraud, or 
        (iv) issues verifying payment.  
        If we cancel your order after payment, we will refund the full amount paid (less any transaction fees).  
      </p>

      <h2>Refunds, Returns, & Exchanges</h2>
      <p>
        We want you to be happy with your purchase. Because candles are consumable and fragile, our return and refund policy has some limitations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Returns or exchanges must be requested within <strong>30 days</strong> of delivery.</li>
        <li>Products must be in unused, resalable condition with original packaging.</li>
        <li>We do <em>not</em> accept returns for items that have been burned, exposed to flame, or show signs of use.</li>
        <li>If an item arrives damaged or defective, please notify us within 48 hours and provide photographic evidence. We may replace the item or issue a refund (including return shipping cost at our discretion).</li>
        <li>Return shipping costs are the responsibility of the purchaser unless the return is due to a defect or error on our part.</li>
        <li>Any refunds will be processed to the original payment method within 7–10 business days after the returned item is received and inspected.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Safety & Use Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        Candles contain open flames, hot wax, and glass containers. Use them carefully and at your own risk. By purchasing and using our products, you accept the following disclaimers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Always burn candles within sight. Never leave a burning candle unattended.</li>
        <li>Keep candles away from flammable objects (curtains, papers, fabrics, etc.), drafts, and heat sources.</li>
        <li>Keep out of reach of children, pets, and people with limited mobility.</li>
        <li>Do not burn candles on or near uneven or unstable surfaces.</li>
        <li>Always trim the wick to approximately ¼ inch (6mm) before lighting.</li>
        <li>Do not burn candles for more than 4 hours at a time. Extinguish the flame before it reaches the bottom of the container or exposes bare glass.</li>
        <li>The container and exterior of the candle may become hot — do not move while lit or when the wax is molten.</li>
        <li>Do not touch or handle the glass when the candle is burning or shortly after extinguishing; allow it to cool entirely first.</li>
        <li>We are not liable for any damages or injury resulting from misuse, negligence, or improper handling of our products.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, Desert Candle Works and its affiliates, employees, or agents shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from or in connection with your use of our products or services—whether in contract, tort, strict liability, or otherwise—even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Our total liability shall never exceed the purchase price of the product that gave rise to the claim.
      </p>

      <h2>Indemnification</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Desert Candle Works, its officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising out of or related to your use of our products, your violation of these policies, or your negligence or willful misconduct.
      </p>

      <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
      <p>
        Our products are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind, express or implied. We disclaim all implied warranties, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement, to the fullest extent allowed by law.
      </p>

      <h2>Severability & Governing Law</h2>
      <p>
        If any provision of these policies is held invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.  
        These policies and any dispute relating to them or your purchase shall be governed by the laws of the state in which Desert Candle Works is located, without regard to conflict of law principles.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to Policies</h2>
